This repository consists only of pure Javascript programs without any frameworks. All the programs uploaded here were created by me while I was learning JavaScript.
Since these and all projects were made with the motive of learning JavaScript, I have not been involved in CSS that much, so the style of the page might be simple.
I will continuously upload simple JavaScript projects I have created to this repository, so stay updated.
I will give a preview of the webpage link in this read-me file below the name of the project so you can navigate easily.
